Linux Postfix Mail Server

xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:

1. Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.
2. Create an email account yousuf@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by YchZHRcLkL.
3. Set its mail directory to /home/yousuf/Maildir.
4. Install and configure dovecot on the same server.

sudo yum install -y postfix dovecot telnet

Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf:
myhostname = stratos.xfusioncorp.com
mydomain = stratos.xfusioncorp.com
myorigin = $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
mynetworks = 172.16.238.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8
home_mailbox = Maildir/
systemctl start postfix
systemctl status postfix

useradd yousuf
passwd yousuf
cat /etc/passwd | grep yousuf

telnet stmail01 25
ehlo localhost
mail from: yousuf@stratos.xfusioncorp.com
rcpt to: yousuf@stratos.xfusioncorp.com

Edit /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf:

Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
disable_plaintext_auth = yes  #line 10

Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf:

systemctl start dovecot
systemctl status dovecot
