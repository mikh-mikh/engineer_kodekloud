Linux Nginx as Reverse Proxy

Nautilus system admin's team is planning to deploy a front end application for their backup utility on Nautilus Backup Server, so that they can manage the backups of different websites from a graphical user interface. They have shared requirements to set up the same; please accomplish the tasks as per detail given below:

a. Install Apache Server on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to use 3000 port (do not bind it to 127.0.0.1 only, keep it default i.e let Apache listen on server's IP, hostname, localhost, 127.0.0.1 etc).
b. Install Nginx webserver on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to use 8091.
c. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy server for Apache.
d. There is a sample index file /home/thor/index.html on Jump Host, copy that file to Apache's document root.
e. Make sure to start Apache and Nginx services.
f. You can test final changes using curl command, e.g curl http://<backup server IP or Hostname>:8091.

yum install -y nginx httpd
sed -i 's/^Listen 80$/Listen 3000/g' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
scp thor@jump_host:/home/thor/index.html /var/www/html
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf: add "proxy_pass http://localhost:3000" to "server" block and location "/", edit "listen" port:

server {
        listen       8091 default_server;
        listen       [::]:8091 default_server;
        server_name  _;
        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        }

systemctl enable --now httpd
systemctl enable --now nginx
