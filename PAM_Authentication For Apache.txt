PAM Authentication For Apache

We have a requirement where we want to password protect a directory in the Apache web server document root. We want to password protect http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected URL as per the following requirements (you can use any website-url for it like localhost since there are no such specific requirements as of now). Setup the same on App server 2 as per below mentioned requirements:

a. We want to use basic authentication.
b. We do not want to use htpasswd file based authentication. Instead, we want to use PAM authentication, i.e Basic Auth + PAM so that we can authenticate with a Linux user.
c. We already have a user anita with password LQfKeWWxWD which you need to provide access to.
d. You can test the same using a curl command from jump host curl http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected.

yum --enablerepo=epel -y install mod_authnz_external pwauth

check user "anita":
from reguar user (steve):
[steve@stapp02 ~]$ su anita (promt anita's password from task)
[anita@stapp02 steve]$  (ok we login)
exit

add to /etc/httpd/conf.d/authnz_external.conf:

<Directory /var/www/html/protected>
AuthType Basic
AuthName "PAM Authentication"
AuthBasicProvider external
AuthExternal pwauth
require valid-user
</Directory>

systemctl enable --now httpd (may be httpd is disabled)



curl stapp02:8080/protected/index.html (we got 401)
curl stapp02:8080/protected/ (we got 401)
curl stapp02:8080/protected  (we got 401)

curl -u anita stapp02:8080/protected/index.html
Enter host password for user 'anita': (enter anita's password from task)
