Ansible Archive Module

The Nautilus DevOps team has some data on each app server in Stratos DC that they want to copy to a different location. 
However, they want to create an archive of the data first, then they want to copy the same to a different location on the respective app server. 
Additionally, there are some specific requirements for each server. Perform the task using Ansible playbook as per requirements mentioned below:

Create a playbook named playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, 
an inventory file is already placed under /home/thor/ansible/ directory on Jump Server itself.

Create an archive ecommerce.tar.gz (make sure archive format is tar.gz) of /usr/src/dba/ directory ( present on each app server ) 
and copy it to /opt/dba/ directory on all app servers. 
The user and group owner of archive ecommerce.tar.gz should be tony for App Server 1, steve for App Server 2 and banner for App Server 3.

inventory:

stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n ansible_user=tony
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@ ansible_user=steve
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n ansible_user=banner

playbook.yaml:

- name: tar and copy to amother loc
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
   - name: As per the task create the archive file and set the owner
     archive:
       path: /usr/src/dba/

       format: gz
       force_archive: true
       owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
       group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
