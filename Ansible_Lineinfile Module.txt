Ansible Lineinfile Module

The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task as per details mentioned below.
We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Write a playbook playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. Using the playbook perform below given tasks:

Install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.
Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:

This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:

Welcome to Nautilus Group!

Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.
The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.
The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0644 on all app serve
