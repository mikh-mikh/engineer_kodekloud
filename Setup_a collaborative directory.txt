Setup a collaborative directory

The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the sysadmin group of the team.
Setup a collaborative directory /sysadmin/data on app server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.
The directory should be group owned by the group sysadmin and the group should own the files inside the directory. The directory should be read/write/execute to the user and group owners, and others should not have any access.

mkdir -P /sysadmin/data
chgrp -R /sysadmin/data/

chmod -R 2770 /sysadmin/data/
ls -lsd /sysadmin/data/
4 drwxrws--- 2 root sysadmin 4096 Jan 12 22:21 /sysadmin/data/
