Apache Troubleshooting

xFusionCorp Industries uses some monitoring tools to check the status of every service, application, etc running on the systems. Recently, the monitoring system identified that Apache service is not running on some of the Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter.

1. Identify the faulty Nautilus Application Server and fix the issue. Also, make sure Apache service is up and running on all Nautilus Application Servers. Do not try to stop any kind of firewall that is already running.
2. Apache is running on 3001 port on all Nautilus Application Servers and its document root must be /var/www/html on all app servers.
3. Finally you can test from jump host using curl command to access Apache on all app servers and it should be reachable and you should get some static page. E.g. curl http://172.16.238.10:3001/.

ssh to servers and run to get errors:
systemctl enable --now httpd

after run:
systemctl status httpd
and look at the errors. they will be in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf with number of line.
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
(fix errors - hint: enter ": line_number with error" to set cursor on needed line)

systemctl enable --now httpd
in my case server stapp02 didn't has errors - but service was disabled and stopped

check from jumphost:
curl stapp01:3001
curl stapp02:3001
curl stapp03:3001
