Docker Python App

A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 3. We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 3. Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:
Create a Dockerfile under /python_app directory:
Use any python image as the base image.
Install the dependencies using requirements.txt file.
Expose the port 6400.
Run the server.py script using CMD.
Build an image named nautilus/python-app using this Dockerfile.
Once image is built, create a container named pythonapp_nautilus:
Map port 6400 of the container to the host port 8096.
Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 3.
curl http://localhost:8096/

Dockerfile:

FROM python:alpine

WORKDIR /python_app

COPY . .

RUN pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt

CMD ["python3", "src/server.py"]

EXPOSE 6400

docker build -t nautilus/python-app .
docker run -d --name pythonapp_nautilus -p 8096:6400 nautilus/python-app
