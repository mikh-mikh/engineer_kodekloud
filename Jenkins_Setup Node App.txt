Jenkins Setup Node App

The Nautilus application development team is working on to develop a Node app. They are still in the development phase however they want to deploy and test their app on a containerized environment and using a Jenkins pipeline. Please find below more details to complete this task.
Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.
Similarly, click on the Gitea button on the top bar to access the Gitea UI. Login using username sarah and password Sarah_pass123.
There is a repository named sarah/web in Gitea, which is cloned on the Storage server under /home/sarah/web directory.
A Dockerfile is already present under the git repository, please push the same to the origin repo if not pushed already.
Create a jenkins pipeline job named node-app and configure it as below:
Configure it to deploy the app on App Server 3
The pipeline must have two stages Build and Deploy (names are case sensitive)
In the Build stage, build an image named stregi01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5000/node-app:latest using the Dockerfile present under the Git repository. stregi01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5000 is the image registry server. After building the image push the same to the image registry server.
In the Deploy stage, create a container named node-app using the image you build it the Build stage. Make sure to map the container port with host port 8080.

Note:

You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also, Jenkins UI sometimes gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end. In this case, please make sure to refresh the UI page.

For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.



1. Install plugins:  SSH  & publish over SSH, ssh creds, credentails, Pipeline (+ job, nodes and processes, basic steps, stage step) Git, ssh Build Agents

2. Setup credentials for stapp03 server user, #sarah, ststor01 user (natasha)

3. setup agent stapp03, #ssh host stapp03

3.5 go to ststor01 to /home/sarah/web and  check and push Dockerfile - if this is not presented/Dockerfile broken on sarah/web repo in gitea server:
ssh sarah@ststor01
cd /home/web/sarah
git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean


4. go to Jenkins and create a Pipeline Job named node-app

pipeline {
    agent {
        label "stapp03"
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Get some code from a GitHub repository
                git branch: "master",
                    url: "https://80-port-cf09c396cb0d4961.labs.kodekloud.com/sarah/web.git",
                    credentialsId: "sarah"
                // Run docker on a Unix agent.
                sh "docker build -t stregi01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5000/node-app:latest /home/banner/workspace/node-app"
                sh "docker push stregi01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5000/node-app:latest"
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh "docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name node-app stregi01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5000/node-app:latest"
            }
        }
    }
}

5. check (there is no button "app" in KK because i do not know why):

curl stapp03:8080
