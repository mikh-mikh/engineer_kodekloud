Install and Configure PHP-FPM

The Nautilus application development team is planning to launch a new PHP-based application, which they want to deploy on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The development team had a meeting with the production support team and they have shared some requirements regarding the infrastructure. Below are the requirements they shared:

a. Install nginx on app server 2 , configure it to use port 8093 and its document root should be /var/www/html.
b. Install php-fpm version 8.2 on app server 2, it should listen on port 9000.
c. Configure php-fpm and nginx to work together.
d. Once configured correctly, you can test the website using curl http://stapp02:8093/index.php command from jump host.
