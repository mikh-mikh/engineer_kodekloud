IPtables Installation And Configuration

We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 6000 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.
2. Block incoming port 6000 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.
3. Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

yum install -y iptables-services

systemctl enable --now iptables
iptables -R INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 6000 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT 
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6000 -j DROP
service iptables save

check with curl from lb server & app servers cross-by-cross
