Linux GPG Encryption

We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.

On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. Use those keys to perform the following actions.

Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.

Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).

Debugging
ssh to storage server, ls /home:
decrypt_me.asc
private_key.asc
Solution

cd /home
gpg --import private_key.asc (enter the passphrase "kodekloud" and press ok)
gpg --list-keys
gpg -o encrypted_me.asc --batch --passphrase kodekloud -c encrypt_me.txt
gpg -d -o decrypted_me.txt --batch --passphrase kodekloud decrypt_me.asc
