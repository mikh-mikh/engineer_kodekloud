Linux Process Troubleshooting

The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.

Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, just make sure service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 3003 on all app servers.

curl stapp01:3003 (refused - this server is bad)
curl stapp02:3003 (ok)
curl stapp03:3003 (ok)

ssh to stapp01

systemctl start httpd (errors, i forget to look about bind port errors)
in my case port 3003 was binded by "sendmail", i used this to see:
netstat -ntlp 3003

stop and disable sendmail:
systemctl disable --now sendmail

systemctl enable --now httpd (may be httpd is disabled)

curl stapp01:3003 (ok)
curl stapp02:3003 (ok)
curl stapp03:3003 (ok)
