Ansible Create Users and Groups

Several new developers and DevOps engineers just joined the xFusionCorp industries. They have been assigned the Nautilus project, and as per the onboarding process we need to create user accounts for new joinees on at least one of the app servers in Stratos DC. We also need to create groups and make new users members of those groups. We need to accomplish this task using Ansible. Below you can find more information about the task.
There is already an inventory file ~/playbooks/inventory on jump host.
On jump host itself there is a list of users in ~/playbooks/data/users.yml file and there are two groups — admins and developers —that have list of different users. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/add_users.yml on jump host to perform the following tasks on app server 1 in Stratos DC.

a. Add all users given in the users.yml file on app server 1.
b. Also add developers and admins groups on the same server.
c. As per the list given in the users.yml file, make each user member of the respective group they are listed under.
d. Make sure home directory for all of the users under developers group is /var/www (not the default i.e /var/www/{USER}). Users under admins group should use the default home directory (i.e /home/devid for user devid).
e. Set password YchZHRcLkL for all of the users under developers group and 8FmzjvFU6S for of the users under admins group. Make sure to use the password given in the ~/playbooks/secrets/vault.txt file as Ansible vault password to encrypt the original password strings. You can use ~/playbooks/secrets/vault.txt file as a vault secret file while running the playbook (make necessary changes in ~/playbooks/ansible.cfg file).
f. All users under admins group must be added as sudo users. To do so, simply make them member of the wheel group as well.

1. make add_users.yml:

- hosts: stapp01
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  vars_files:
    - ~/playbooks/passwords.yml
  vars:
    users_data_file: ~/playbooks/data/users.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Create developers and admins groups
      group:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - developers
        - admins
    - name: Read users from YAML file
      include_vars:
        file: "{{ users_data_file }}"
        name: users
    - name: Create admin users and assign to group admins
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        group: admins
        # home: "/home/{{ item }}"
        password: "{{ admin_password | password_hash('sha512') }}"
      loop: "{{ users.admins }}"
      when: users.admins is defined
    - name: Create developer users and assign to group developers
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        group: developers
        home: /var/www
        password: "{{ developer_password | password_hash('sha512') }}"
      loop: "{{ users.developers }}"
      when: users.developers is defined
    - name: Add users to the 'wheel' group
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        groups: wheel
        append: true
      loop: "{{ users.admins }}"
      when: users.admins is defined

2. make passwords.yml

developer_password: YchZHRcLkL
admin_password: 8FmzjvFU6S

3. ecrypt passwords.yml with vault:

ansible-vault encrypt passwords.yml --vault-password-file ~/playbooks/secrets/vault.txt

4. add string to ansible.conf:
echo "vault_password_file = ~/playbooks/secrets/vault.txt"

5. run playbook

ansible-playbook -i inventory add_users.yml

6. check:
ansible stapp01 -a "cat /etc/passwd" -i inventory

7. check manually login with 1 user from group and password from task:

ssh jim@stapp01

ssh rob@stapp01
sudo su
