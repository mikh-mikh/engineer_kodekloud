Install and Configure Web Application

xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 3.
b. Apache should serve on port 5003.
c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/news and /home/thor/demo on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that news should work on the link http://localhost:5003/news/ and demo should work on link http://localhost:5003/demo/ on the mentioned app server.
d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:5003/news/ and curl http://localhost:5003/demo/
