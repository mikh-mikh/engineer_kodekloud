Docker Node App

There is a requirement to Dockerize a Node app and to deploy the same on App Server 1. Under /node_app directory on App Server 1, we have already placed a package.json file that describes the app dependencies and server.js file that defines a web app framework.

Create a Dockerfile (name is case sensitive) under /node_app directory:

Use any node image as the base image.
Install the dependencies using package.json file.
Use server.js in the CMD.
Expose port 3001.

The build image should be named as nautilus/node-web-app.
Now run a container named nodeapp_nautilus using this image.
Map the container port 3001 with the host port 8092.

Once deployed, you can test the app using a curl command on App Server 1:
curl http://localhost:8092


FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /node_app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

EXPOSE 3001

docker build -t nautilus/node-web-app .
docker run -p 8092:3001 --name nodeapp_nautilus -d nautilus/node-web-app
