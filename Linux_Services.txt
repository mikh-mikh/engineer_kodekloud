a. Install postfix package on all the application servers.
b. Once installed, make sure it is enabled to start during boot.


yum install postfix -y
vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

myhostname = smtp.example.local

inet_interfaces = all
inet_protocols = all
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost,
