Ansible Manage Services

Developers are looking for dependencies to be installed and run on Nautilus app servers in Stratos DC. They have shared some requirements with the DevOps team. Because we are now managing packages installation and services management using Ansible, some playbooks need to be created and tested. As per details mentioned below please complete the task:

a. On jump host create an Ansible playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and configure it to install vsftpd on all app servers.
b. After installation make sure to start and enable vsftpd service on all app servers.
c. The inventory /home/thor/ansible/inventory is already there on jump host.
d. Make sure user thor should be able to run the playbook on jump host.

check inventory:
ansible -m ping -i inventory all

- name: Install the latest version of vsftpd
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Install the latest version of vsftpd
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: vsftpd
      state: present
  - name: start and enable service vsftpd
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: vsftpd
      enabled: yes
      state: started

run playbook
ansible -i inventory playbook.yml

check service status:
ansible all -a "systemctl status vsftpd" -i inventory
