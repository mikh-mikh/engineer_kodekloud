Linux Run Levels

New tools have been installed on the app servers in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. Therefore, there are some requirements for these app servers as below.

On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter, change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default. Please do not try to reboot these servers after completing this task.

systemctl get-default
systemctl set-default graphical.target
systemctl start graphical.target
systemctl status graphical.target
