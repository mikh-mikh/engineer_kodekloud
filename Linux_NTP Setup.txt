Linux NTP Setup

1. Install and configure NTP server on App Server 2.
2. Add NTP server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 2.
3. Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we don't want these changes to be applied right now.

sudo yum install ntp 

/etc/ntp.conf:
server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org iburst
systemctl status ntp
